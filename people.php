				Ashley Linder is a graduate student in Neuroscience. She grew up in California, and abandoned a promising career as a junior competitive surfer during a near drowning experience. Her fear of the ocean prompted her to stay indoors to study mathematics (she double-majored in Math and Neuroscience at  UCSD) and, eventually, propelled her to Princeton, as far away from the Pacific Ocean as she could get. Ashley has resumed surfing and sold her life story rights to make the movie Blue Crush, starring Kate Bosworth.

				Fred Shipley is a full time Research Assistant.  He grew up in Brooklyn, where a botched blood infusion as a child resulted in him being able to sense electromagnetic fields in an environment.  This engendered an interest in biophysics, which he studied at Amherst while working in the lab of Ashley Carter. Fred graduated Amherst with degrees in Physics and in Biochemsitry and Biophysics.  When not in lab, Fred enjoys competitive hot dog eating and developing his abilities as a snake charmer.

				George is a full time research assistant.  He grew up in the harsh weather of Minnesota, and endured many bouts of the cold. His body often induced fevers, which resulted in fantastical fever dreams.  These dreams sparked his curiosity in neurobiology, which he studied at Harvard under the supervision (or lack thereof) of Florian Engert.  In his free time, George enjoys becoming mediocre at things he is bad at.

				Raj is a visiting postdoc from the lab of Leonid Kruglyak. He received his PhD from the lab of Scott Emmons at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He is interested in the neurogenetics of behavioral diversity in natural populations. He thinks Colbert-the lab robot-will replace his fondness for Wall-e.
