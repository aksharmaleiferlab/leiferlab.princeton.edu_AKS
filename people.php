				Ashley Linder is a graduate student in Neuroscience. She grew up in California, and abandoned a promising career as a junior competitive surfer during a near drowning experience. Her fear of the ocean prompted her to stay indoors to study mathematics (she double-majored in Math and Neuroscience at  UCSD) and, eventually, propelled her to Princeton, as far away from the Pacific Ocean as she could get. Ashley has resumed surfing and sold her life story rights to make the movie Blue Crush, starring Kate Bosworth.

				Mochi is a graduate student in the QCB program. He grew up in the mean streets of suburban San Diego, where daily drive-by shootings in front of his low-income housing prompted him to move to rustic Berkeley, CA for his undergraduate education. It was at UC Berkeley that Mochi became interested in how biological things worked, and he eventually graduated with a degree in Bioengineering. Outside of work, he likes to play tug of war against fish and read about trivial issues such as arms control.

			<p class="member-bio">Sherif is a research assistant in the Leifer lab. He grew up in Cairo, Egypt before moving to the US to study molecular biology, joining the Hazard Lab at Montclair State University as an undergrad. In 2011, he spent a summer at the Sternberg lab at Caltech, where Paul advised him to look into systems biology. He then collaborated with the Zinn lab at Caltech, analyzing biological networks. After graduating, he joined the Ploss lab at Princeton to study viral infectious kinetics. In his spare time, Sherif enjoys reading, working out and listening to metal.
