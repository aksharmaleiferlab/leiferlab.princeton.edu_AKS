	<p>The Leifer lab uses optical neurophysiology techniques, such as optogenetics and calcium imaging, to study the neural basis of behavior in the nematode <i>C. elegans</i>.

		How do a collection of neurons work together to receive information from the environment, encode that information, and then process it to generate purposeful behavior? This is the fundamental question confronting researchers in the field of systems neuroscience. The Leifer Lab is working towards answering this question by studying neural circuits in the small worm <i>C. elegans</i>.

<h3>Why C. Elegans?</h3>
<p>Invertabrate model organisms have yielded many universal principles of neuroscience. Our understanding of the molecular basis of learning and memory, for example, came initially from studies of <i>Aplysia</i>, a giant sea slug. Similarly, our understanding of motor circuits was informed by early studies of leech and lamprey.<p> 
	<p>The nematode <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> is a popular and robust model organism and a natural tool to study systems neuroscience. With only 302 neurons, its nervous system is compact but tractable. The 1 mm-long nematode exhibits a rich array of behaviors. It senses its environment, navigates toward food and temperatures  that it prefers, avoids chemicals that it dislikes, and responds to touch. The worm even exhibits associative learningâ€“ it can associate odors with foods that make it sick, and avoid them accordingly, for example.</p>
	<p> Importantly <i>C. elegans</i> has a number of properties which makes it well suited to optical neurophysiology studies. The entire wiring diagram of the <i>C. elegans</>  nervous system (its connectome) has been mapped completely. The worm is easy to manipulate genetically, and its optically transparent body provides easy access for optical tools. <i>C. elegans</i>, with its compact nervous system, genetic tractability, optical access and well-mapped neural circuitry, is an ideal candidate for studying the neural dynamics underlying behavior</p>
